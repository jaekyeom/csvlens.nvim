1. csvlens.nvim                                    *csvlens.nvim-csvlens.nvim*

A way to easily preview CSV files, as well as other separated filetypes,
directly in neovim. Backed by YS-L/csvlens <https://github.com/YS-L/csvlens>.


https://github.com/theKnightsOfRohan/csvlens.nvim/assets/114779675/07cf5178-4231-4515-8c35-0b2027f76ae8


NOTES                                        *csvlens.nvim-csvlens.nvim-notes*

Requires Neovim version 0.7.0 or greater. This plugin depends on
toggleterm.nvim <https://github.com/akinsho/toggleterm.nvim> as the UI for the
previewer.


QUICKSTART                              *csvlens.nvim-csvlens.nvim-quickstart*


LAZY.NVIM INSTALLATION ~

>lua
    return {
        "theKnightsOfRohan/csvlens.nvim",
        dependencies = {
            "akinsho/toggleterm.nvim"
        },
        config = true,
    }
<


CONFIG ~

This plugin requires you to have csvlens <https://github.com/YS-L/csvlens>
installed and in your PATH. You can install it automatically with this plugin,
and it will be installed in $HOME/.local/bin, or you could install it using
your terminal package manager of choice. You can also manually specify the path
of the executable as part of the configuration.

A default config will contain the following:

>lua
    require("csvlens").setup({
        direction = "float", -- "float" | "vertical" | "horizontal" |  "tab"
        exec_path = "csvlens", -- You can specify the path to the executable if you wish. Otherwise, it will use the command.
    })
<

Due to the way the toggleterm API works, the csvlens preview config will take
precedence over the toggleterm config for csvlens’s previews.


USAGE                                        *csvlens.nvim-csvlens.nvim-usage*

This plugin is designed to be simple and easy to use. Open the csv file that
you want to preview, then use the command `:Csvlens` to open a window with the
preview of the opened table. The keyboard commands in this window are the same
as csvlens’s. Typing `H` in the preview will open up the help menu for
csvlens, where you can find the keybindings.

You can also open a file with custom delimiters by passing them as string
arguments to the command. For example, `:Csvlens "$"` would open the preview as
if the open file were separated by `$`. All separators must be one character,
with the exception of `\t`. However, this plugin will automatically use tabs as
the delimiter if opening a tsv file.


ALTERNATIVES                          *csvlens.nvim-csvlens.nvim-alternatives*

VidocqH/data-viewer.nvim <https://github.com/VidocqH/data-viewer.nvim> - This
plugin supports sqlite as well - However, I don’t like how the UI looks.
csvlens looks much better to me, which is why I wanted to make this port.
